A)

The yaml file for part A is pod-basic.yaml.
Command to create the pod: kubectl apply -f pod-basic.yaml
Command to get the pod using an appropriate selector: kubectl get pods  --selector "greeting=personalized"
Command to get logs of pod: kubectl logs hello
Output of logs command: Hello, !
This is what I expected because NAME had no value so it would appear as ‘’.
Command to delete the pod: kubectl delete pods hello

B)

The yaml file for part B is pod-basic-1.yaml.
Command to create the pod: kubectl apply -f pod-basic-1.yaml
Command to get logs of pod: kubectl logs hello
Output of logs command: Hello, Cole!
Command to delete the pod: kubectl delete pods hello

C)

The yaml file for part C is pod-deployment.yaml.
Command to create deployment: kubectl apply -f pod-deployment.yaml
Command to get the pods with IP addresses: kubectl get pods -o wide
Output:
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP             NODE   NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

Commands to get logs of the pods:
kubectl logs hello-deployment-76d9879bc9-bg2t2
Output: Hello, Cole from IP 10.244.3.183.

kubectl logs hello-deployment-76d9879bc9-grvwv
Output: Hello, Cole from IP 10.244.7.137.

kubectl logs hello-deployment-76d9879bc9-jzkpq
Output: Hello, Cole from IP 10.244.4.144.

The outputs do not match the outputs of part B due to the new environment variable.
